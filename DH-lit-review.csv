Digital Humanities,"Roy, Dibyadyuti ;  Deshbandhu, Aditya","The year's work in critical and cultural theory, 2024-10",,,,,"Current conversations around the manifestations of artificial intelligence have led to binary viewpoints that either predict apocalyptic visions of imminent human obsolescence or forthcoming machinic sentience and technological singularity. Amid these polarized perspectives, the materiality of massive digital infrastructures that regularly exploit vulnerable labour forces and the environmental costs driving such emerging forms of digitality are being systematically erased. As a field bridging humanistic enquiry and computational methods, digital humanities finds itself at the epicentre of such debates around the potentials and pitfalls of what artificial intelligence and its futures imply for scholarly and humanistic practices. Therefore, this chapter identifies and reviews interventions from 2023 and early 2024, across both discursive and physical locations, to show how current disciplinary conversations in digital humanities must emerge from both traditional and unconventional sites, which navigate the intersections between artificial and human domains, while emphasizing the provocations and issues that will shape the future of the field.",,,,ISSN: 1077-4254; EISSN: 1471-681X; DOI: 10.1093/ywcct/mbae019,,,,,,,,,,CRKN Oxford University Press Current,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1093_ywcct_mbae019

I en nærmere afgrænsning vælger artiklen den tendens i DH, der betragter DH som forbundet med ""making"" og ""building"" af digitale objekter og former. Dette kan også karakteriseres som DH som praktisk-produktiv vending. Artiklen har valgt tre typer af digitalisering. De er valgt ud fra, at de skal repræsentere forskellige måder at håndtere digitaliseringen på og forskellige versioner af den praktisk-produktive vending. Artiklen undersøger tre typer digitalisering fra 1990erne til i dag ud fra denne optik. De repræsenterer forskellige former for approach til digitalisering og det digitale dokument og afspejler forskellige typer af problemstillinger i overgangen fra trykkekultur til digital kultur. For det første problemstillingen omkring digitalisering af litterær kulturarv med fokus på kodning og tagging af teksten samt organisering i hypertekststrukturer. For det andet reorganiseringen af det digitale dokument i dataelementer og database. For det tredje konstruktionen af multimodal og multimedial dokumentformidling og ""remixing"" af dokumenter.

Digital humanities—A discipline in its own right?

Blackwell; 2004) and its position in the overall academic landscape are still being negotiated. While there are countless essays and opinion pieces that debate the status of DH, little research has been dedicated to exploring the field in a systematic and empirical way (Poole, Journal of Documentation; 2017:73). This study aims to contribute to the existing research gap by comparing articles published over the past three decades in three established English‐language DH journals (Computers and the Humanities, Literary and Linguistic Computing, Digital Humanities Quarterly) with research articles from journals in 15 other academic disciplines (corpus size: 34,041 articles; 299 million tokens). As a method of analysis, we use latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, combined with recent approaches that aggregate topic models by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Our findings indicate that DH is simultaneously a discipline in its own right and a highly interdisciplinary field, with many connecting factors to neighboring disciplines—first and foremost, computational linguistics, and information science. Detailed descriptive analyses shed some light on the diachronic development of DH and also highlight topics that are characteristic for DH.",,,,ISSN: 2330-1635; EISSN: 2330-1643; DOI: 10.1002/asi.24533,,,"Hoboken, USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc",,,,,,,Wiley Online Library; Scopus; Business Source Complete; Science Citation Index Expanded; Social Sciences Citation Index,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1002_asi_24533

It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics.
Design/methodology/approach - The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis.
Findings - There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science.
Research limitations/implications - This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain.
Originality/value - The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.",,,,ISSN: 0022-0418; EISSN: 1758-7379; DOI: 10.1108/JD-05-2017-0076,,,BINGLEY: Emerald Group Publishing,,,,,,,"Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA); Computer Science Database; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 150 Collection; Scopus; Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 120 Collection; Arts & Humanities Database; Art, Design & Architecture Collection (Proquest) (PQ_SDU_P3); Social Sciences Citation Index; Alma/SFX Local Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald",,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1108_JD_05_2017_0076

Replicating the human ability to connect Vision and Language has recently been gaining a lot of attention in the Computer Vision and the Natural Language Processing communities. This research effort has resulted in algorithms that can retrieve images from textual descriptions and vice versa, when realistic images and sentences with simple semantics are employed and when paired training data is provided. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and tackle the design of visual-semantic algorithms in the domain of the Digital Humanities. This setting not only advertises more complex visual and semantic structures but also features a significant lack of training data which makes the use of fully-supervised approaches infeasible. With this aim, we propose a joint visual-semantic embedding that can automatically align illustrations and textual elements without paired supervision. This is achieved by transferring the knowledge learned on ordinary visual-semantic datasets to the artistic domain. Experiments, performed on two datasets specifically designed for this domain, validate the proposed strategies and quantify the domain shift between natural images and artworks.",,,,ISSN: 0167-8655; EISSN: 1872-7344; DOI: 10.1016/j.patrec.2019.11.018,,,AMSTERDAM: Elsevier B.V,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Decision Sciences; Scopus; CRKN Elsevier Additional Journals; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Computer Science; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Current; Science Citation Index Expanded,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_2352369015

While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it's corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities.

Inscription serves as a fundamental rhetorical device in research outputs and practices. As many inscriptions are deeply rooted in a scientific research paradigm, they can be used to evaluate the level of scientificity of a scientific field. This is specifically helpful to understand the relationships between research traditions in digital humanities (DH), a highly cross‐disciplinary between various humanities and scientific traditions. This paper presents a quantitative, community‐focused examination of how inscriptions are used in English‐language research articles in DH journals. We randomly selected 252 articles published between 2011 and 2020 from a representative DH journal list, and manually classified the inscriptions and author domains in these publications. We found that inscriptions have been increasingly used during the past decade, and their uses are more intensive in publications led by STEM authors comparing to other domains.

DNNs are the state‐of‐the‐art machine learning algorithms solving many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection, question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns from a large number of “right” and “wrong” examples and apply them to new examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for domain adaptation.

The purpose of this paper is to dissect key issues and debates in digital humanities, an emerging field of theory and practice. Digital humanities stands greatly to impact the Information and Library Science (ILS) professions (and vice versa) as well as the traditional humanities disciplines.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper explores the contours of digital humanities as a field, touching upon fundamental issues related to the field’s coalescence and thus to its structure and epistemology. It looks at the ways in which digital humanities brings new approaches and sheds new light on manifold humanities foci.
Findings
Digital humanities work represents a vital new current of interdisciplinary, collaborative intellectual activity both in- and outside the academy; it merits particular attention from ILS.
Research limitations/implications
This paper helps potential stakeholders understand the intellectual and practical framework of the digital humanities and “its relationship” to their own intellectual and professional work.
Originality/value
This paper critically synthesizes previous scholarly work in digital humanities.

An associative text analyzer to facilitate effectiveness of exploring historical texts for digital humanities,"Chen, Chih-Ming ;  Chen, Xian-Xu","ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, 2024-08",,"Computer Science ;  Computer Science, Information Systems ;  Information Science & Library Science ;  Science & Technology ;  Technology",,,"PurposeThis study aims to develop an associative text analyzer (ATA) to support users in quickly grasping and interpreting the content of large amounts of text through text association recommendations, facilitating the identification of the contextual relationships between people, events, organization and locations for digital humanities. Additionally, by providing text summaries, the tool allows users to link between distant and close readings, thereby enabling more efficient exploration of related texts.Design/methodology/approachTo verify the effectiveness of this tool in supporting exploration of historical texts, this study uses a counterbalanced design to compare the use of the digital humanities platform for Mr. Lo Chia-Lun's Writings (DHP-LCLW) with and without the ATA to assist in exploring different aspects of text. The study investigated whether there were significant differences in effectiveness for exploring textual contexts and technological acceptance as well as used semi-structured in-depth interviews to understand the research participants' viewpoints and experiences with the ATA.FindingsThe results of the experiment revealed that the effectiveness of text exploration using the DHP-LCLW with and without the ATA varied significantly depending on the topic of the text being explored. The DHP-LCLW with the ATA was found to be more suitable for exploring historical texts, while the DHP-LCLW without the ATA was more suitable for exploring educational texts. The DHP-LCLW with the DHP-LCLW was found to be significantly more useful in terms of perceived usefulness than the DHP-LCLW without the ATA, indicating that the research participants believed the ATA was more effective in helping them efficiently grasp the related texts and topics during text exploration.Practical implicationsThe study's practical implications lie in the development of an ATA for digital humanities, offering a valuable tool for efficiently exploring historical texts. The ATA enhances users' ability to grasp and interpret large volumes of text, facilitating contextual relationship identification. Its practical utility is evident in the improved effectiveness of text exploration, particularly for historical content, as indicated by users' perceived usefulness.Originality/valueThis study proposes an ATA for digital humanities, enhancing text exploration by offering association recommendations and efficient linking between distant and close readings.

Whereas previously students were immersed in the fluidity of campus life, they have become suspended and drawn-into various streams and currents of digital pedagogy, which articulate new forms of epistemological movement, often operating at speeds outside the lived time and rhythm of human thought. When assessing learning technologies, we have to consider the degree to which they complement the rhythms immanent to human thought, knowledge, investigation, and experimentation.In this paper, we examine learning from a humanities perspective, arguing that reading, writing, and thinking are ways of learning underscored by various genres of movement that segue with or diverge from the movements inherent to digital technologies, especially those deployed in learning systems. Using the work of thinkers such as John Dewey and Michel Serres, we examine the importance of movement in dialogue, where to truly learn involves embedding oneself in the flow of thought, accepting the flexibility of concepts, and aligning oneself with a community of thinkers.",,,,ISSN: 0039-3746; EISSN: 1573-191X; DOI: 10.1007/s11217-023-09912-5,,,DORDRECHT: Springer Nature,,,,,,,Canadian Research Knowledge Network SpringerLink Current; Arts & Humanities Citation Index; Social Sciences Citation Index; Scholars Portal Journals: Springer,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_webofscience_primary_001135991800001CitationCount

Through semi-structured interviews conducted with eight librarians from four universities, along with observation of their actual work and investigation of the library websites, this study explored these librarians' perceptions of DH pedagogy and their understandings about the role of “DH librarian.” The findings show that the role of a DH librarian can be seen as a liaison among different stakeholders, a group of specialists, or a collective title. The importance of humanities versus technical backgrounds and the practical skills a DH librarian needs to support DH pedagogy are discussed. The findings also indicate that an ideal practice of DH pedagogy requires balanced collaboration, a clear framework, a closer partnership, ample investment in human and technical resources, and high valuation of non-book scholarship.",,,,ISSN: 0099-1333; EISSN: 1879-1999; DOI: 10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102524,,,NEW YORK: Elsevier Inc,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Social Science; Scopus; CRKN Elsevier Additional Journals; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Current; Social Sciences Citation Index,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_webofscience_primary_000891669200002

The Meaning of the Digital Humanities,"LIU, ALAN","PMLA : Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, 2013-03, Vol.128 (2), p.409-423",,Arts & Humanities ;  Criticism ;  Digital humanities ;  History instruction ;  Humanities ;  Humans ;  Liberal arts education ;  Literary criticism ;  Literary history ;  Literature ;  News media ;  Novels ;  Register ;  Self concept ;  Semantics ;  the changing profession ;  Understory ;  Words,,,"This question of disciplinary meaning—which I ask from the viewpoint of the humanities generally—is larger than the question of disciplinary identity now preoccupying “DH” itself, as insiders call it. Having reached a critical mass of participants, publications, conferences, grant competitions, institutionalization (centers, programs, and advertised jobs), and general visibility, the field is vigorously forming an identity. Recent debates about whether the digital humanities are a “big tent” (Jockers and Worthey), “who's in and who's out?” (Ramsay), whether “you have to know how to code [or be a builder]” (Ramsay, “On Building”), the need for “more hack, less yack” (Cecire, “When Digital Humanities”; Koh), and “who you calling untheoretical?” (Bauer) witness a dialectics of inclusion and exclusion not unlike that of past emergent fields. An ethnographer of the field, indeed, might take a page from Claude Lévi-Strauss and chart the current digital humanities as something like a grid of affiliations and differences between neighboring tribes. Exaggerating the differences somewhat, as when a tribe boasts its uniqueness, we can thus say that the digital humanities—much of which affiliates with older humanities disciplines such as literature, history, classics, and the languages; with the remediation of older media such as books and libraries; and ultimately with the value of the old itself (history, archives, the curatorial mission)—are not the tribe of “new media studies,” under the sway of the design, visual, and media arts; Continental theory; cultural criticism; and the avant-garde new. Similarly, despite significant trends toward networked and multimodal work spanning social, visual, aural, and haptic media, much of the digital humanities focuses on documents and texts in a way that distinguishes the field's work from digital research in media studies, communication studies, information studies, and sociology. And the digital humanities are exploring new repertoires of interpretive or expressive “algorithmic criticism” (the “second wave” of the digital humanities proclaimed in “The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0” [3]) in a way that makes the field not even its earlier self, “humanities computing,” alleged to have had narrower technical and service-oriented aims. Recently, the digital humanities' limited engagement with identity and social-justice issues has also been seen to be a differentiating trait—for example, by the vibrant #transformDH collective, which worries that the digital humanities (unlike some areas of new media studies) are dominantly not concerned with race, gender, alternative sexualities, or disability.",,,,ISSN: 0030-8129; EISSN: 1938-1530; DOI: 10.1632/pmla.2013.128.2.409; CODEN: PMLAAY,,,NEW YORK: Modern Language Association of America,,,,,,,Scopus; JSTOR Journals and Primary Sources; Cambridge Journals Online; Arts & Humanities Citation Index; Scholars Portal Journals: Cambridge Current; JSTOR,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_webofscience_primary_000344912900015

A hierarchical topic analysis tool to facilitate digital humanities research,"Chen, Chih-Ming ;  Ho, Szu-Yu ;  Chang, Chung","ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, 2023-01, Vol.75 (1), p.1-19",,"Computer Science ;  Computer Science, Information Systems ;  Context ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Data mining ;  Design of experiments ;  Digital archives ;  Digital humanities ;  Digital humanities research platform ;  Dirichlet problem ;  Effectiveness ;  Hierarchical topic modelling ;  Information retrieval ;  Information Science & Library Science ;  Information technology ;  Information visualization ;  Metadata ;  Modelling ;  Online data bases ;  Reading ;  Research methodology ;  Science & Technology ;  Segmentation ;  Technology ;  Technology assessment ;  Technology utilization ;  Text mining ;  Texts ;  Topic analysis",,,"PurposeThis study aims to develop a hierarchical topic analysis tool (HTAT) based on hierarchical Latent Dirichelet allocation (hLDA) to support digital humanities research that is associated with the need of topic exploration on the Digital Humanities Platform for Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings (DHP-LCLW). HTAT can assist humanities scholars on distant reading with analysis of hierarchical text topics, through classifying time-stamped texts into multiple historical eras, conducting hierarchical topic modeling (HTM) according to the texts from different eras and presenting through visualization. The comparative network diagram is another function provided to assist humanities scholars in comparing the difference in the topics they wish to explore and to track how the concept of a topic changes over time from a particular perspective. In addition, HTAT can also provide humanities scholars with the feature to view source texts, thus having high potential to be applied in promoting the effectiveness of topic exploration due to simultaneously integrating both the topic exploration functions of distant reading and close reading.Design/methodology/approachThis study adopts a counterbalanced experimental design to examine whether there is significant differences in the effectiveness of topic inquiry, the number of relevant topics inquired and the time spent on them when research participants were alternately conducting text exploration using DHP-LCLW with HTAT or DHP-LCLW with Single-layer Topic Analysis Tool (SLTAT). A technology acceptance questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were also conducted to understand the research participants' perception and feelings toward using the two different tools to assist topic inquiry.FindingsThe experimental results show that DHP-LCLW with HTAT could better assist the research participants, in comparison with DHP-LCLW with SLTAT, to grasp the topic context of the texts from two particular perspectives assigned by this study within a short period. In addition, the results of the interviews revealed that DHP-LCLW with HTAT, in comparison with SLTAT, was able to provide a topic terms that better met research participnats' expectations and needs, and effectively guided them to the corresponding texts for close reading. In the analysis of technology acceptance and interview data, it can be found that the research participants have a high and positive tendency toward using DHP-LCLW with HTAT to assist topic inquiry.Research limitations/implicationsThe Jieba Chinese word segmentation system was used in the Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings Database in this study, to perform word segmentation on Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s writing texts for topic modeling based on hLDA. Since Jieba word segmentation system is a lexicon based word segmentation system, it cannot identify new words that have still not been collected in the lexicon well. In this case, the correctness of word segmentation on the target texts will affect the results of hLDA topic modeling, and the effectiveness of HTAT in assisting humanities scholars for topic inquiry.Practical implicationsAn HTAT was developed to support digital humanities research in this study. With HTAT, DHP-LCLW provides hmanities scholars with topic clues from different hierarchical perspectives for textual exploration, and with temporal and comparative network diagrams to assist humanities scholars in tracking the evolution of the topics of specific perspectives over time, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall context of the texts.Originality/valueIn recent years, topic analysis technology that can automatically extract key topic information from a large amount of texts has been developed rapidly, but the topics generated from traditional topic analysis models like LDA (Latent Dirichelet allocation) make it difficult for users to understand the differences in the topics of texts with different hierarchical levels. Thus, this study proposes HTAT which uses hLDA to build a hierarchical topic tree with a tree-like structure without the need to define the number of topics in advance, enabling humanities scholars to quickly grasp the concept of textual topics and use different hierarchical perspectives for further textual exploration. At the same time, it also provides a combination function of temporal division and comparative network diagram to assist humanities scholars in exploring topics and their changes in different eras, which helps them discover more useful research clues or findings.",,,,ISSN: 2050-3806; EISSN: 2050-3814; EISSN: 1758-3748; DOI: 10.1108/AJIM-11-2021-0325,,,Leeds: Emerald Publishing Limited,,,,,,,Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA); Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 150 Collection; Scopus; Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 120 Collection; Science Citation Index Expanded; Social Sciences Citation Index; Alma/SFX Local Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald,,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_webofscience_primary_000788670500001CitationCount
