## Analog Coding

This can be done by a computer at a large scale, which allows for easy textual analysis and topic modelling (as long as the text or transcript has been cleaned and preprocessed).

[Nvivo](https://carleton.ca/its/nvivo/) and [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) are examples of tools that help automate this process.
